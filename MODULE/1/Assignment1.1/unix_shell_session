                               metadata change time (-c): ctime, status;
                               modified time (default): mtime, modification;
                               birth time: birth, creation;
                             with -l, WORD determines which time to show;
                             with --sort=time, sort by WORD (newest first)

      --time-style=TIME_STYLE
                             time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below
  -t                         sort by time, newest first; see --time
  -T, --tabsize=COLS         assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8
  -u                         with -lt: sort by, and show, access time;
                             with -l: show access time and sort by name;
                             otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

  -U                         do not sort; list entries in directory order
  -v                         natural sort of (version) numbers within text
  -w, --width=COLS           set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit
  -x                         list entries by lines instead of by columns
  -X                         sort alphabetically by entry extension
  -Z, --context              print any security context of each file
      --zero                 end each output line with NUL, not newline
  -1                         list one file per line
      --help        display this help and exit
      --version     output version information and exit

The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).
Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.
FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,
then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.
TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.
Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

The WHEN argument defaults to 'always' and can also be 'auto' or 'never'.

Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and
with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when
standard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment
variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors(1) command to set it.

Exit status:
 0  if OK,
 1  if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),
 2  if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

[?2004lUsage: grep [OPTION]... PATTERNS [FILE]...
Search for PATTERNS in each FILE.
Example: grep -i 'hello world' menu.h main.c
PATTERNS can contain multiple patterns separated by newlines.

Pattern selection and interpretation:
  -E, --extended-regexp     PATTERNS are extended regular expressions
  -F, --fixed-strings       PATTERNS are strings
  -G, --basic-regexp        PATTERNS are basic regular expressions
  -P, --perl-regexp         PATTERNS are Perl regular expressions
  -e, --regexp=PATTERNS     use PATTERNS for matching
  -f, --file=FILE           take PATTERNS from FILE
  -i, --ignore-case         ignore case distinctions in patterns and data
      --no-ignore-case      do not ignore case distinctions (default)
  -w, --word-regexp         match only whole words
  -x, --line-regexp         match only whole lines
  -z, --null-data           a data line ends in 0 byte, not newline

Miscellaneous:
  -s, --no-messages         suppress error messages
  -v, --invert-match        select non-matching lines
  -V, --version             display version information and exit
      --help                display this help text and exit

Output control:
  -m, --max-count=NUM       stop after NUM selected lines
  -b, --byte-offset         print the byte offset with output lines
  -n, --line-number         print line number with output lines
      --line-buffered       flush output on every line
  -H, --with-filename       print file name with output lines
  -h, --no-filename         suppress the file name prefix on output
      --label=LABEL         use LABEL as the standard input file name prefix
  -o, --only-matching       show only nonempty parts of lines that match
  -q, --quiet, --silent     suppress all normal output
      --binary-files=TYPE   assume that binary files are TYPE;
                            TYPE is 'binary', 'text', or 'without-match'
  -a, --text                equivalent to --binary-files=text
  -I                        equivalent to --binary-files=without-match
  -d, --directories=ACTION  how to handle directories;
                            ACTION is 'read', 'recurse', or 'skip'
  -D, --devices=ACTION      how to handle devices, FIFOs and sockets;
                            ACTION is 'read' or 'skip'
  -r, --recursive           like --directories=recurse
  -R, --dereference-recursive  likewise, but follow all symlinks
      --include=GLOB        search only files that match GLOB (a file pattern)
      --exclude=GLOB        skip files that match GLOB
      --exclude-from=FILE   skip files that match any file pattern from FILE
      --exclude-dir=GLOB    skip directories that match GLOB
  -L, --files-without-match  print only names of FILEs with no selected lines
  -l, --files-with-matches  print only names of FILEs with selected lines
  -c, --count               print only a count of selected lines per FILE
  -T, --initial-tab         make tabs line up (if needed)
  -Z, --null                print 0 byte after FILE name

Context control:
  -B, --before-context=NUM  print NUM lines of leading context
  -A, --after-context=NUM   print NUM lines of trailing context
  -C, --context=NUM         print NUM lines of output context
  -NUM                      same as --context=NUM
      --group-separator=SEP  print SEP on line between matches with context
      --no-group-separator  do not print separator for matches with context
      --color[=WHEN],
      --colour[=WHEN]       use markers to highlight the matching strings;
                            WHEN is 'always', 'never', or 'auto'
  -U, --binary              do not strip CR characters at EOL (MSDOS/Windows)

When FILE is '-', read standard input.  With no FILE, read '.' if
recursive, '-' otherwise.  With fewer than two FILEs, assume -h.
Exit status is 0 if any line is selected, 1 otherwise;
if any error occurs and -q is not given, the exit status is 2.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped.[m
[m
       Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the [1m--add [22moption. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a[m
       [1mvalue-pattern [22m(which is an extended regular expression, unless the [1m--fixed-value [22moption is given) needs to be given. Only the existing values that match the[m
       pattern are updated or unset. If you want to handle the lines that do [1mnot [22mmatch the pattern, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also the[m
       section called “EXAMPLES”), but note that this only works when the [1m--fixed-value [22moption is not in use.[m
[m
       The [1m--type=<type> [22moption instructs [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m to ensure that incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the given <type>. If no [1m--type=<type>[0m[m
       is given, no canonicalization will be performed. Callers may unset an existing [1m--type [22mspecifier with [1m--no-type[22m.[m
[m
       When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository local configuration files by default, and options [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m, [1m--local[22m,[m
       [1m--worktree [22mand [1m--file <filename> [22mcan be used to tell the command to read from only that location (see the section called “FILES”).[m
[m
       When writing, the new value is written to the repository local configuration file by default, and options [1m--system[22m, [1m--global[22m, [1m--worktree[22m, [1m--file <filename>[0m[m
       can be used to tell the command to write to that location (you can say [1m--local [22mbut that is the default).[m
[m
       This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit codes are:[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to[m
       internals.[m
[m
       See [1mgittutorial[22m(7) to get started, then see [1mgiteveryday[22m(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The [34m[1mGit User’s Manual[0m[1m[22m[1] has a more in-depth introduction.[m
[m
       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands[m
       with "git help command". [1mgitcli[22m(7) manual page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.[m
[m
       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at [34m[1mhttps://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html [0m[1m[22mor [34m[1mhttps://git-scm.com/docs[0m[1m[22m.[m
[m
[1mOPTIONS[0m[m
       -v, --version[m
           Prints the Git suite version that the [4mgit[24m program came from.[m
[m
           This option is internally converted to [1mgit version ...  [22mand accepts the same options as the [1mgit-version[22m(1) command. If [1m--help [22mis also given, it takes[m
           precedence over [1m--version[22m.[m
[m
       -h, --help[m
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option [1m--all [22mor [1m-a [22mis given then all available commands are printed. If a Git[m
           command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command.[m
[m
           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See [1mgit-help[22m(1) for more information, because [1mgit --help ...  [22mis converted[m
           internally into [1mgit help ...[22m.[m
[m
       -C <path>[m
           Run as if git was started in [4m<path>[24m instead of the current working directory. When multiple [1m-C [22moptions are given, each subsequent non-absolute [1m-C <path>[0m[m
           is interpreted relative to the preceding [1m-C <path>[22m. If [4m<path>[24m is present but empty, e.g.  [1m-C ""[22m, then the current working directory is left unchanged.[m
[m
           This option affects options that expect path name like [1m--git-dir [22mand [1m--work-tree [22min that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative[m
           to the working directory caused by the [1m-C [22moption. For example the following invocations are equivalent:[m
